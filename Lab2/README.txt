What were the learning objectives of this lab?
The learning objectives of this lab were to learn how to represent an adder, register, and mux using logic gates, and also conversion between hexadecimal and signed decimal values. This lab also taught us how to use D flip flops to represent a 4-bit register, use carry outs to calculate signed decimal numbers, and implement edge sensitive logic. 

What was your design approach?
My design approach was to follow the path of the model provided to us: first implement whack check and score adjustment, then the adder, then the register, and finally display logic. The whack check logic came fairly quickly to me, and was easy to implement. Then I had to figure out how to represent a 4 bit adder using logic gates, and after that how to use those values in a D flip flop to store the score. Finally, using logic gates to implement the function of a mux allowed me to choose whether to use the positive or negative signed decimal number.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
Some issues I encountered in this lab were figuring out how to represent the clock in the D flip flop, how to represent the mux to be able to choose whether to use the positive or negative number, and converting the hexadecimal number into its 2s compliment using logic gates. The part of this game I found enjoyable was playing the game once it was completed!

How would you redesign this lab assignment to make it better?
To make this lab assignment better, I would add a upper limit to the score, where once reached, the player has won.
