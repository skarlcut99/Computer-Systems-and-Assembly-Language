What did you learn in this lab?
In this lab, I learned how to create a circuit based on a truth table, using AND/OR/NOT gates as a sum of products. I also learned how to implement this truth table using only NAND gates, and also using only NOR gates. I also learned how a truth table can translate into binary. For me, the most important thing I learned was how to represent all gates as either a NAND or a NOR, which helped not only with the understanding the logic in circuits and boolean identities, but also helped me understand how the gates themselves work.

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
One approach that I took that definitely worked well was drawing possible circuit diagrams on paper, and how to implement these diagrams using AND/OR/NOT, NAND, or NOR. This allowed me to visualize what the circuit would look like in MMLogic, making it easier to recreate the actual circuit. Some issues I had were figuring out how to represent all of the different gates as a NAND gate or a NOR, and cleaning up the circuits so they were easier to understand and so it was easier to test my circuit. 

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
To make this lab better, I would add another section to the lab that instructs the students to create the truth table using sum of products, and product of sums, so they can learn how to both methods work. Another way to teach boolean logic is to implement the boolean identities into the circuit, to create a circuit that uses the most identities as possible. This would make the circuit more complicated, but it would also provide a visual representation of all of the boolean identities.
