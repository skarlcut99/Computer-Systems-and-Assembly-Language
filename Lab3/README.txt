-------------------------
The text of your prompts are stored in the processorâ€™s memory. After assembling your program, what is the range of addresses in which these strings are stored?
The range of addresses for static data is Addresses 0x1001 0000 - 0x1004 0000. This is data which will come from the data segment of the program. 

What were the learning objectives of this lab? 
The learning objectives of this lab are to become familiar with the MIPS assembly language, and also retrieve user input, and use nested loops to create a program. Other learning objectives are to learn about the different types of registers and syscalls, and what they can be used for. Conditional statements were also learned through this lab.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
Issues that I encountered were creating the nested loops, producing the correct output, and creating the algorithms for the incrementation and decrementation inside the loops. The part of this lab that I found enjoyable is seeing how memory is used inside programs, and how registers can be manipulated.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better? 
To make this lab better, I would also include conditional if/else statements into the program, as well as loops, for a better understanding of mips.
